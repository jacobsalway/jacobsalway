### Jacob Salway

I'm a data engineer at [Simple Machines](https://simplemachines.com.au). Before my current role, I worked at [Domain](https://domain.com.au) for two years as a data analyst while studying and as a technical data analyst after I graduated. Mid last year, I completed a Bachelor of Science at the University of Sydney majoring in computer science and data science.
