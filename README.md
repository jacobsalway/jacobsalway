### Jacob Salway

I'm a technical data analyst at [Domain](https://www.domain.com.au/) and recent graduate from the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/) with a Bachelor of Science majoring in computer science and data science. My current work at DOmain is a combination of data engineering, analytics, and visualisation.

I have experience using Python, R, Java, and SQL and working with Tableau, Spark, Snowflake, Airflow, and AWS services including EMR and SageMaker. In my spare time, I've been learning and working on projects with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Scala.
